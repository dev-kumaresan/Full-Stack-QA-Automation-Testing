JAVA:
=====

what is java?

Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform
that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others.

It is developed by Sun Microsystems, and it was released in 1995.
James Gosling initially developed Java in Sun Microsystems (which was later merged with Oracle Corporation)


Java: 
        Simple programming language.
	Platform Independent 
	Run multiple application at a time
	Oops based one
	Easy to run and debug  (Compiletime Error and Runtime Error)
Main Features:
	Open sources- free Version
	Platform independent ((Will run in all os).
	Multi threading	
	More Secure.

Features of Java:-
==================
Object-Oriented:
.................
Java supports the features of object-oriented programming.
Its object model is simple and easy to expand.

Platform independent:
.....................
C and C++ are platform dependency languages hence the application programs written in one Operating system cannot run in any other Operating system,
but in platform independence language like Java application programs written in one Operating system can able to run on any Operating system.

Simple:
.......
Java has included many features of C / C ++, which makes it easy to understand.

Secure:
....... 
Java provides a wide range of protection from viruses and malicious programs.
It ensures that there will be no damage and no security will be broken.

Portable: - "Write once run anywhere"
.........   
Java provides us with the concept of portability. 
Running the same program with Java on different platforms is possible.

Robust:
....... 
During the development of the program, it helps us to find possible mistakes as soon as possible.

Multi-threaded:
............... 
The multithreading programming feature in Java allows you to write a program that performs several different tasks simultaneously.


What is an IDE?-Integrated Development Environment 
............
it is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently (or Enables programmers to writing a computer program.). 

It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.

Notepad
Eclipse IDE:((Starting-3.2, Current-14.23, standard-oxygen4.7))
Netbeans
Jdeveloper
Rad
VS

Java Enviranment:
=================

JDK -Java Development kit 
.........................

Eg:Cricket Kit, Safety Kit.

It is a bundle of software development tools and supporting libraries combined with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Whenever we want to run or develop a programe in java JDK is essantial

Starting 1.0 current 1.21 Standard Version 1.8

JRE-Java Runtime Environment- it contains pre defined files and libraries.
.............................

JRE, is a software layer that runs on top of a computerâ€™s operating system software.

It provides the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.

JVM- Java Virtual Machine 
.........................

JVM is specifically responsible for converting bytecode to machine-specific code (Binary Code).  (Loads the code , Verifies code and Executes the code.)

It is also platform-dependent.

Used for Runtime Memory allocation and Object creation.
